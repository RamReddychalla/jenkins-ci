## JUnit Test Result Report in Jenkins

### Overview
JUnit is a widely used testing framework for Java applications. Jenkins integrates seamlessly with JUnit to provide detailed test result reports. These reports help you understand the status and health of your software projects by providing insights into test execution and outcomes.

### Configuration

1. **Install JUnit Plugin**
   - Ensure that the JUnit plugin is installed in Jenkins. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins** > **Available** tab, and search for "JUnit Plugin".

2. **Configure Job for JUnit Reporting**
   - In your Jenkins job configuration, add a build step to execute your tests using Maven, Gradle, or any other build tool.
   - After the build step, add a post-build action to publish JUnit test results:
     - Click on **Add post-build action**.
     - Select **Publish JUnit test result report**.
     - Enter the path to the test result XML files (e.g., `**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml`).

### Reports

Once the job runs and tests are executed, Jenkins generates detailed reports, accessible through the job's build page. The main features of these reports include:

- **Summary of Test Results**: Provides an overview of the total number of tests, passed tests, failed tests, and skipped tests.
- **Test Trends**: Displays trends over time, showing how test results have changed across different builds.
- **Test Cases**: Lists all test cases with their results, including passed, failed, and skipped tests.
- **Failure Details**: Shows detailed information about test failures, including stack traces and error messages.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to configure a simple Maven project to publish JUnit test results:

1. **Create a Maven Project**:
   - Create a new Maven project in Jenkins.
   - Configure the source code repository in the **Source Code Management** section.

2. **Build Step**:
   - Add a build step to **Invoke top-level Maven targets**.
   - Enter `package` in the **Goals** field to run the tests.

3. **Post-Build Action**:
   - Add the **Publish JUnit test result report** post-build action.
   - Enter `**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml` in the **Test report XMLs** field.

### Conclusion

JUnit test result reports in Jenkins provide valuable insights into the state of your tests. By leveraging these reports, you can track test trends, identify failures, and ensure the overall health of your project.

Using this configuration, you can efficiently manage and monitor the results of your JUnit tests within Jenkins.
